Module 12 Challenge: nosql

Description: This challenge uses a json file and named establishments that was provided. I used PyMongo to import the data in the json file to my jupyter notebook. From there I made several changes to the database. Some of these changes included adding a new business to the database, and changing the data type and format of some of the data. 


Code Source: I utlized the Xpert Learning Assistant to assist me in finding the syntax of some functions. I also utlized ChatGPT to assist in the aggregation section of code and the formula for calculating the area within a certain degree of the location.
